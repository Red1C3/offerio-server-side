# For Offerio Devs:
To get the server up for the first time do the following :
- clone the repository.
- run ``composer install`` inside the cloned folder.
- ask me for env file.
- create an empty database file, ``database.sqlite`` at /database.

After these steps you should be able to get the latest repo updates by pulling changes with git.
